The project manager has recently heard that there was another project in the company last year that is similar to his second project. What should he do?',
				explanation: 'There are many things the project manager could do. Asking the other project manager for assistance is not the best choice, as the other project manager might not be an experienced mentor. His advice might not be adequate to help this project manager. Waiting to assess the impact on the project is reactive; a project manager should be proactive. Gaining agreement of all the stakeholders on the project scope is also not the best choice. It would be helpful, but does not specifically address the issue in this situation. By contacting the PMO, the project manager can access the knowledge of many project managers, historical information from many projects, and the assistance of someone whose job it is to help. ',

			},
			{	question: 'To obtain support for the project throughout the performing organization, it`s BEST if the project manager:',
				explanation: 'Connecting the project to the sponsor`s objectives might be a good idea, but it does not address the issue of obtaining support throughout the performing organization. Neither a communications management plan nor an overall management plan directly addresses obtaining support for the project. Correlating the need for the project to the organization`s strategic plan is the best way to gain support for the project. ',

			{	question: 'Your management has decided that all orders will be treated as "projects" and that project managers will be used to update orders daily, to resolve issues, and to ensure the customer formally accepts the product within 30 days of completion. Revenue from the individual orders can vary from US $100 to US $150,000. The project manager will not be required to perform planning or provide documentation other than daily status. How would you define this situation?',
				explanation: 'Because orders are numerous and of short duration, this situation is a recurring process, not a project. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Because each individual order is a "temporary endeavor" each order is a project.' },
					{ answer: 'This is program management since there are multiple projects involved.' },
					{ answer: 'This is a recurring process.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Orders incurring revenue over $100,000 would be considered projects and would involve project management.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'The previous project manager for your project managed it without much project organization. There is a lack of management control and no clearly defined project deliverables. Which of the following would be the BEST choice for getting your project better organized?',
				explanation: 'Developing lessons learned would help improve subsequent phases, but would do nothing for control or deliverables. Having plans for each work package would help control each phase, but would not control the integration of those phases into a cohesive whole. A description of the product of the project would help, but that would not improve both control and deliverables for each phase. Effective project management requires a life cycle approach to running the project. Adopting a I ife cycle approach is the only answer that covers both control and deliverables. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Adopt a life cycle approach to the project.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Develop lessons learned for each phase.' },
					{ answer: 'Develop specific work plans for each work package.' },
					{ answer: 'Develop a description of the product of the project.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'A project team is working on manufacturi ng a new product, but they are having difficulty creating a project charter. What is the BEST description of the real problem?',
				explanation: 'Manufacturing a product is an ongoing process; it is operational work, not project work. Therefore, the manufacturing team would have no reason to create a project charter and would have difficulty doing so if they tried, because of the ongoing nature of the work. If the question referred to a team developing a new product, however, that would qualify as a project. ',

				]
			},
			{	question: 'One of your team members informs you that he does not know which of the many projects he is working on is the most important. Who should determine the priorities between projects in a company?',
				explanation: 'Because the question talks about priorities between projects, this cannot be the role of the project manager, the project management team, or the project team. Determining priorities between projects is a role of the PMO. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'TIle project manager' },
					{ answer: 'The project management team' },

			},
			{	question: 'The difference between a project, program, and portfolio is:',
				explanation: 'A project is a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program is a group of related projects, and a portfolio is a group of projects and programs related to a specific strategic objective. Remember to use the process of elimination, ruling out any answer that is not completely correct. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'A project is a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program may include other nonproject work, and a portfolio is all the projects in a given department or division.' },
					{ answer: 'A project is a lengthy endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program combines two or more unrelated projects, and a portfolio combines two or more programs.' },

					{ answer: 'A part of every project activity.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Company procedures require the creation of a lessons learned document. Which of the following is the BEST use oflessons learned?',
				explanation: 'Notice that this question asks about the use of a tool of project management. Many people can learn from a book what a lessons learned document is, but questions like this can more readily be answered if you actually use the tool and know from experience its value. Ask yourself about the other tools of project management. Why are they beneficial? The BEST use of lessons learned is as historical records for future projects. There are other tools that are better for accomplishing the things listed in the other choices. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Historical records for future projects', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Planning record for the current project' },

					{ answer: 'The team.' },
					{ answer: 'The sponsor.' },
					{ answer: 'The stakeholders.', correct: true },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Consideration of ongoing operations and maintenance is crucially important to products of projects. Ongoing operations and maintenance should:',
				explanation: 'Remember the definition of a project: temporary and unique. Operations and maintenance are considered ongoing activities, not temporary. Therefore, such work is not considered a project or part of a project. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Be included as activities to be performed during project closure.' },
					{ answer: 'Have a separate phase in the project life cycle, because a large portion of life cycle costs is devoted to maintenance and operations.' },

					{ answer: 'Functional manager.' },
					{ answer: 'Sponsor.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Which of the following is NOT an input to the initiating process group?',
				explanation: 'Notice the question asks which is NOT an input to project initiating. Did you read it correctly? Companies should have processes in place for hiring resources, reporting, and managing risks on projects (to name only a few). These are inputs to project initiating, as are company culture and historical WBSs. The project scope statement is an output of project planning.',

					{ answer: 'Project scope statement', correct: true },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'The project sponsor has just signed the project charter. What is the NEXT thing to do?',
				explanation: 'To answer this type of question, look for the choice that occurs closest to the process group you are in. The project charter is created during project initiating. Completing work packages is done during project executing. Validating scope and performing integrated change control are done during project monitoring and controlling. Starting to create management plans is the best choice, as it is part of project planning.',
				answers: [

			{	question: 'The WBS and WBS dictionary are completed. The project team has begun working on identifying risks. The sponsor contacts the project manager, requesting that the responsibility assignment matrix be issued. The project has a budget of US $100,000 and is taking place in three countries using 14 human resources. There is little risk expected for the project, and the project manager has managed many projects similar to this one. What is the NEXT thing to do?',
				explanation: 'Look at the order of planning the project that the team has chosen. Although understanding the experience of the sponsor might sound like a good idea, the sponsor is a stakeholder and understanding the stakeholders is part of stakeholder analysis. That should have occurred before the creation of a WBS. Project scope must be defined before a WBS can be created. Completing risk management and issuing the responsibility assignment matrix cannot be best, as that work does not come next in the process. Other work must be done before risk management can effectively be completed. Creating an activity list comes next after the WBS and WBS dictionary.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Understand the experience of the sponsor on similar projects.' },

			{	question: 'A project manager does not have much time to spend on planning before the mandatory start date arrives. He therefore wants to move through planning as effectively as possible. What advice would you offer?',
				explanation: 'This question is asking which of the choices is the most effective way to move through project planning. Starting the WBS immediately after obtaining a project charter skips the important steps of defining the scope and other activities. High-level assumptions are determined in project initiating. Quality metrics are determined as part of the quality management plan, not after it. The aclivily list is created before the network diagram, so that is the best option.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Make sure you have a signed project charter and then start the WBS.' },
					{ answer: 'Create an activity list before creating a network diagram.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Document all the known risks before you document the high-level assumptions.' },

			{	question: 'A project manager gets a call from a team member notifying him that there is a variance between the speed of a system on the project and the desired or planned speed. The project manager is surprised because that performance measurement was not identified in planning. If the project manager then evaluates whether the variance warrants a response, he is in which part of the project management process?',
				explanation: 'Even though the measurement was not identified in planning, the project manager would still have to investigate the variance and determine if it is important. The project manager is in project monitoring and controlling.',

			{	question: 'Which of the following is the MOST appropriate thing to do during the initiating process group?',
				explanation: 'A detailed description of the project deliverables is created during project planning, as part of creating the project scope statement. Root cause analysis occurs during project monitoring and controlling, not initiating. Ensuring all project management processes are complete occurs during project closing.

			{	question: 'The customer has accepted the completed project scope. However, the lessons learned required by the project management office have not been completed. What is the status of the project?',
				explanation: 'Replanning is uncalled for by the situation described. Reaching the planned completion date does not mean the project is necessarily finished. A project is complete when all work, including all project management work, is complete and the product of the project and all project deliverables are accepted. The lessons learned are project management deliverables, and therefore must be completed for the project to be complete.',
				answers: [

			{	question: 'The customer on a project tells the project manager they have run out of money to pay for the project. What should the project manager do FIRST?',
				explanation: 'Every project must be closed, as closure provides benefit to the performing organization. This means simply stopping work is not the best choice. Shifting work and releasing team members do not solve the problemï¿½they just postpone dealing with it. The best thing for the project manager to do is begin the Close Project or Phase process.',

				explanation: 'This question is asking for the most important of the choices. Think about what is involved in integration: project management plan development, project management plan execution, and integrated change control. Updates and product control are parts of project monitoring and controlling, while integration includes more than control. Advancing the careers of team members falls under project executing (the Develop Project Team process).

				explanation: 'Determining who will be on the change control board and determining the reporting structure may have already been done. In any case, these choices are not directly impacted by the number of sponsors who have signed the charter. Having a single project sponsor is not necessary. This situation implies that there are six areas concerned with this project.

			{	question: 'It is the middle of the project when the project manager is informed by her scheduler that the project control limits are secure. That same morning she receives a note from a team member about a problem he is having. The note says, "This activity is driving me crazy, and the manager of the accounting department won`t help me until the activity`s float is in jeopardy." In addition, the project manager has e-mails from a minor stakeholder and 14 e-mails from team members. While she is reading the e-mails, a team member walks into the project manager`s office to tell her a corrective action was implemented by a team member from the project management office, but was not documented. What should the project manager do NEXT?',
				explanation: 'Notice how many situations are thrown at you in this question. It is important to practice reading through questions to discover what is important and what is just background information. In this question, the only thing relevant was the corrective action taken. Once you discover what the primary issue is, look at the choices to find out which is best for addressing that issue. What is the primary issue here? Did you realize the team member`s note is about a non-critical path activity? ("Until the project float is in jeopardy" means there is float and, thus, it is not on the critical path.) So is the issue the noncritical path activity or the documentation? You might disagree with the logic, but in this case the answer is the documentation. In the real world, problems often repeat. Without a record of what was done, there is no opportunity to consider the same solution for future problems. Documentation is critical to projects. Because the change log becomes part of the historical records database, it is best to first record the corrective action taken, then discuss the value of documentation at the next team meeting, and smooth the team member`s issue with the accounting department.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Report the documentation violation to the project management office, evaluate the security of the control limits, and review the e-mailing rules in the communications management plan.' },
					{ answer: 'Clarify the reasoning behind documentation being a problem, get the accounting department to assist the team member, and respond to the minor stakeholder.' },
					{ answer: 'Add the implemented corrective action to the change log, discuss the value of documentation at the next team meeting, and smooth the team member`s issue with the accounting department.', correct: true },

			{	question: 'The client demands changes to the product specification that will add only two weeks to the critical path. Which of the following is the BEST thing for the project manager to do?',
				explanation: 'Do you remember what to do when there is a change? Evaluate first. You wouldn`t take action before getting approval, so compressing the schedule or cutting scope would happen after consulting the sponsor and/or advising the client of the impact of the change. You would not go to the customer before going to your internal management, so advising the client is not the correct thing to do next. The next step is to discuss options with the sponsor.',

				explanation: 'The project manager is asking how to make a change. Such a question cannot be resolved using management by objectives, team relations, or a work breakdown structure. The procedures, forms, sign-offs, and other similar requirements for handling changes should have already been determined in the change management plan.

			{	question: 'The project was going well when all of a sudden there were changes to the project coming from multiple stakeholders. After all the changes were determined, the project manager spent time with all the stakeholders to find out why there were changes and to discover any more. The project work has quieted down when a team member casually mentions to the project manager that he added functionality to a product of the project. "Do not worry:` he says, "I did not impact time, cost, or quality!" What should the project manager do FIRST?',
				explanation: 'Notice that the first paragraph is extraneous. Also notice that the question states that the change has already been made. The project manager`s actions would be different if the change had not been made. The project manager, with the help of others, must determine how a change impacts the project as a whole. Asking the team member how he knows there is no impact on time, cost, or quality is the best answer. This begins the project manager`s analysis of the impacts to the project as a whole by finding out what analysis has already been done. This change minimally involves a change to the scope baseline, and likely other baselines. A change request must ultimately be submitted to integrated change control, but that is not listed as an option.',

The stakeholder supplies a technical review letter from his department proving that the new way to complete the work package will actually be faster than the old way. The project manager has had similar experiences with this department on other projects, and was expecting this to happen on this project. What is the FIRST thing the project manager should do?',
				explanation: 'Complaining about the missed deadline could be done, but it is not proactive. It would be helpful to get to the root cause of why this department always comes up with such ideas or changes after the project begins.

			{	question: 'The engineering department has uncovered a problem with the cost accounting system and has asked the systems department to analyze what is wrong and fix the problem. You are a project manager working with the cost accounting programs on another project. Management has issued a change request to the change control board to add the new work to your project. Your existing project has a cost performance index (CPI) of 1.2 and a schedule performance index (SPI) of 1.3, so you have some room to add work without delaying your existing project or going over budget. However, you cannot see how the new work fits within the project charter for your existing project. After some analysis, you determine that the new work and existing work do not overlap and can be done concurrently. They also require different skill sets. Which of the following is the BEST thing to do?',
				explanation: 'How long did it take you to read this question? Expect long-winded questions on the exam. Take another look at the choices before you continue reading. Did you notice that each of the choices occurs during a different part of the project management process? This question is essentially asking if the new work should be added to the existing project. There may be many business reasons to try to do this, but from a project management perspective, major additions to the project are generally discouraged. In this case, the new work is a self-contained unit of work, has no overlap with the existing work, does not fit within the project charter, and needs a different skill set. Therefore, it is best to make it a new project. The first step to answering this question is to realize that the work should be a separate project. The second step is to look at the choices and see which relates to initiating a new project. Reestimating the project sounds like the best choice only if you did not realize that the new work should be a separate project. Validating scope is done during project monitoring and controlling, and does not relate to the decision of whether to add work to the project.

Management of the change is not complete when the Control Scope process is completed. It is important to look at the impact of the change on other parts of the project, such as time and cost. Therefore, performing integrated change control is the best thing to do next. This would probably be followed by making sure the impact of the change is understood by the stakeholder, then determining why this scope was not identified in planning, and asking the stakeholder if there are more changes expected.',

Being tired of such comments, the project manager reports to the team member`s boss that the team member is not cooperating. Which of the following is MOST likely the real problem?',
				explanation: 'The project manager is not losing resources (which is implied by not getting the manager`s buy-in). Although a reward system would help with cooperation, the real problem here is not cooperation. Meeting with the team member and his boss cannot be the answer because it also does not solve the problem at hand (the team member not knowing what he is to do). If you selected this choice, be very careful! You can get 10 to 20 questions wrong on the exam simply because you do not see the real problem! The whole discussion of the team member and his actions is a distracter. The real problem in this scenario is not that the team member is being uncooperative. He is asking a question that many team members want to ask in the real world. "How can I tell you how things are going if I do not know what work I am being asked to do?" The real problem is the lack of a WBS and work packages. If there were a WBS and work packages for the project, the team member would not have to ask such a question.',

				explanation: 'There is no reason to think that the board`s rejection would not contain an explanation already, since providing that information is commonly done. Suggesting a change process that circumvents the change control board`s authority is not ethical. There is no reason to think that approval processes are not already in place.

				explanation: 'There are many pieces of data in this question that are distracters from the real issue. Though it is common to have to cut costs and add resources to a project, nothing in the question should lead you to think these will be required in this situation. Customers do not generally approve the project scope (what you are going to do to complete their requirements); instead, they approve the product scope (their requirements).

			{	question: 'Which of the following is CORRECT in regard to the Control Scope process?',
				explanation: 'Though it is correct that effective scope definition can lead to a more complete project scope statement, this cannot be the answer, because it does not deal with control. Scope planning occurs before the Control Scope process, not after it. Controlling the schedule is not the best way to control scope, so that is not the best answer. The control processes do not act in isolation. A change to one will most likely affect the others.
